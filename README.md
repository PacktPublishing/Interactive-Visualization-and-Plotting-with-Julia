This is the GitHub repository containing all the code examples for 
[Interactive Visualization and Plotting with Julia](https://www.packtpub.com/product/interactive-visualization-and-plotting-with-julia/9781801810517), published by Packt. 

**Create impressive data visualizations through Julia packages such as Plots,
Makie, Gadfly, and more**

You can read more about the book or buy it at the [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Visualization-Plotting-Julia-visualizations/dp/1801810516) and [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/interactive-visualization-and-plotting-with-julia) websites.

In this git repository, there is a folder for each book chapter. In those
folders are the files defining the project environment used when creating the
examples. The code examples are
available as Julia files, Jupyter, or Pluto notebooks. 

You can see the **rendered Jupyter and Pluto notebooks** on this website: [https://packtpublishing.github.io/Interactive-Visualization-and-Plotting-with-Julia/](https://packtpublishing.github.io/Interactive-Visualization-and-Plotting-with-Julia/)

While the [website](https://packtpublishing.github.io/Interactive-Visualization-and-Plotting-with-Julia/) 
helps you see the **cell outputs** without running the notebooks,
they are not interactive, and some visualization will be missing. In such cases,
running the notebook on your computer is highly recommended.


## Errata

**Page 252 - Figure 9.1**: Sadly, the plot captured for the figure is one of the ones that doesn't change its leaves after sorting. The figure should be:

![figure91](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2822757/188184997-17084fb6-b8af-4e7d-8857-13a3a4100edf.png)

**Page 263**: In the paragraph after the code block of step 6, it should say `run_server`, as it appears in the code, instead of `run_serve`.
